## MindWare: Efficient Open-source AutoML System.
**MindWare** is an efficient open-source system to help users to automate the process of 1) data pre-processing, 2) feature engineering, 3) algorithm selection, 4) architecture design, 5) hyper-parameter tuning, and 6) model ensembling.
It is capable of improving its AutoML power by decomposing the entire large AutoML search space into small ones, and solve each sub-problems jointly and efficiently.
MindWare is designed and developed by the AutoML team from the <a href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DAIR Lab</a> at Peking University.
The goal is to make machine learning easier to apply both in industry and academia, and help facilitate data science.


## Who Should Consider MindWare
* Non-expert users who want to use machine learning techniques in their applications.
* ML Platform owners who want to support AutoML in their platform.
* Researchers and data scientists who want to experiment new AutoML algorithms, may it be: hyper-parameter tuning algorithm, neural architect search method, etc.


## Design Principles

- __User friendliness.__ MindWare needs few human assistance. To use MindWare, the users can define the task by writing only a few lines of code, regardless of the techinical details of the execution of the system.
- __High extensibility.__ New state-of-the-art ML algorithms or feature engineer operations can be added to the system. The decomposition techniques in MindWare ensures the efficiency of finding the best configurations over the enlarged search space. 
- __Advanced characteristic.__ MindWare provides special supports for large datasets. In addition, MindWare enables transfer-learning, meta-learning techniques to make AutoML with more intelligent behaviors.

## Installation
MindWare requires *python>=3.6*. There are two ways to install MindWare:
### Installation via pip
MindWare is available on PyPI. You can install it by tying:

```sh
pip install mindware
```

### Manual installation
If you want to try the latest version, please manually install MindWare from source code by:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thomas-young-2013/mindware.git && cd mindware
cat requirements/main.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
python setup.py install --user
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide Document](https://mindware.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/installation_guide.html).

## Example

Here is a brief example that uses the package.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from mindware.utils.data_manager import DataManager
from mindware.estimators import Classifier

iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=1, stratify=y)
dm = DataManager(X_train, y_train)
train_data = dm.get_data_node(X_train, y_train)
test_data = dm.get_data_node(X_test, y_test)

clf = Classifier(time_limit=3600)
clf.fit(train_data)

pred = clf.predict(test_data)
```
